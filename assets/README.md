# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can:
1. Use the provided `icon-template.svg` as a base
2. Convert it to PNG at the required sizes
3. Or create your own icons with a shopping/cart theme

## Quick Icon Creation

You can use online tools like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Or any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple colored squares with the letter "M" for "Market Shopper".
